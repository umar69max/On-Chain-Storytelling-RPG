# On-Chain Storytelling RPG

## Project Description  
This project is a blockchain-based multiplayer RPG where players create characters, embark on quests, and collectively influence an evolving story directly on-chain. Each playerâ€™s actions and quest outcomes are recorded immutably, making the narrative transparent and community-driven.

## Project Vision  
To build a decentralized gaming experience where the story is not controlled by a single entity but evolves based on the collective decisions and achievements of its players, creating a truly collaborative and transparent RPG.

## Key Features  
- **Character Creation:** Players can create and manage their own RPG characters on-chain.  
- **Quests & Experience:** Characters can undertake quests to gain experience, level up, and progress.  
- **On-Chain Storytelling:** Quest outcomes contribute to a shared, evolving story visible to the entire community.  
- **Immutable Records:** All actions are securely recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof game history.  

## Future Scope  
- Implement NFT-based characters and items that evolve with the story.  
- Add multiplayer events and battles that affect the story collectively.  
- Integrate DAO governance for players to vote on story directions.  
- Introduce off-chain oracles for richer story input like real-world events.  
- Create a frontend interface for smoother gameplay experience.
